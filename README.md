# Off-grid Solar Design for Poultry Farm – Version 1

This project presents a standalone solar PV system designed to meet the energy needs of a rural poultry farm in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. The goal was to ensure a reliable, independent power supply for lighting, ventilation, and water pumping equipment, with 2–3 days of battery autonomy.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- 📍 Location: Barquisimeto, Venezuela
- 🐔 Loads: Fans, LED lighting, and a water pump
- ☀️ Solar Resource: Average daily irradiation of [insert value] kWh/m²/day
- ⚙️ System Type: Off-grid PV with batteries

## 📐 Scope of Work
- Energy demand estimation and load profiling
- Manual sizing of solar panels, batteries, inverter, and charge controller
- System layout and energy balance
- Technical specifications and rationale for component selection
